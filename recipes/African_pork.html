    <h1> Fried Pork</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
1kg of pork

Black paper

Salt

4 big tomatoes ( finely chopped)

2 big onions ( finely chopped)

2 carrots ( grated)

2 cloves of garlic ( finely chopped)

I green paper

2 Irish potatoes optional chopped to four pieces

This pork stew is mostly cooked at home and served for lunch or dinner with food. Pay attention to the step by step process of making the perfect Ugandan pork stew

<h3>Preparation</h3>
step 1
I Separate the pork skin from the pork meat, and I cut the pieces of pork skin further into small pieces. I then cut the meat pieces into the right sizes with a sharp knife.

step 2
Then I rub a little  salt, black pepper and a1 clove of crushed garlic on the pork meat  and  I cover it with fling paper or foil  and let it rest for 1 to 2 hours, preferably in the fridge

You can jump the resting period if there is no time to the resting period

step 3
In a thick based saucepan or cooking pot, I place all pieces of pork skin and cook it over moderate heat. The pork skin soon starts to produce oil, I keep turning it to avoid it from burning. The pork skin will start changing colour from white to brown as it produces more oil. I cook the pork skin in its oil until it becomes brown and crunchy.  This method removes extra fat from the pork skin and leaves it crunchy. This process will take at least 30  minutes.

step 4
I pour the natural pork oil that has been generated by the pork skin out into a bowel and places the cooking pot back over the heat. I let the pork skin produce new oil for 1 to 2 minutes and then I add the rest of the meat to the skin in the cooking pot.  I cook the skin and pork meat together, as I turn it to avoid burning.

The pork meat will also start browning, turn it on all sides to ensure that all the sides have browned. 

step 5
I then season my pork by adding onions, carrots, green pepper, garlic respectively, I cook this mixture for 1-2 minutes until they have become tender, then add my tomatoes to the mixture and cook them until soft and they make a sauce, I then add salt, a pinch of black paper and curry powder to taste.

step 6
I then add three cups of water to make the stew soup. I then add in my 8 pieces of Irish potatoes cut from the 2 potatoes to the soup. I then cover the cooking pot and bring the stew to a boil.  I let the pork boil on moderate heat for close to one hour as I monitor the soup.  I let the soup reduce to a level of 1 cup to half a cup, the pork stew is now ready

step 7
The pork stew in Uganda will be served for lunch or dinner, with common Ugandan foods like matooke, rice, posho, pumpkin, Ugandan millet bread, cassava,yam,
